# TUTORIAL: Deploying Sophia smart contracts with init parameters

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial will walk you through the deployment of smart contracts with init parameters through the use of forgae.

## Prerequisites

You have completed [this tutorial](smart-contract-deployment-in-forgae.md) that teaches you how to deploy a contract without init parameters.

## Step 0. Create a project and run your forgae node

We would need a local node to compile and deploy on. The easiest option is to spawn one from forgae. Follow the below steps to create a project, initialize the project and test the project using forgae on your CLI

```
mkdir forgae-init
cd forgae-init
forgae init
forgae node
```

#### Output of `forgae init`:

```
===== Initializing ForgAE =====
===== Installing aepp-sdk =====
===== Installing ForgAE locally =====
===== Installing yarn locally =====
===== Creating project file & dir structure =====
===== Creating contracts directory =====
===== Creating tests directory =====
===== Creating integrations directory =====
===== Creating deploy directory =====
===== Creating docker directory =====
===== ForgAE was successfully initialized! =====
```

#### Output of `forgae node`:

```
===== Starting node =====
....Creating network "forgae-init_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "forgae-init_node1_db" with default driver
Creating volume "forgae-init_node1_keys" with default driver
Creating volume "forgae-init_node2_db" with default driver
Creating volume "forgae-init_node2_keys" with default driver
Creating volume "forgae-init_node3_db" with default driver
Creating volume "forgae-init_node3_keys" with default driver

.Creating forgae-init_proxy_1 ... 
Creating forgae-init_node2_1 ... 
Creating forgae-init_node2_1 ... done
Creating forgae-init_proxy_1 ... done
Creating forgae-init_node1_1 ... done
Creating forgae-init_node3_1 ... done
.
.
.........................
===== Node was successfully started! =====
===== Funding default wallets! =====
[List of wallet public keys, private keys, and balances]
===== Default wallets was successfully funded! =====
```

#### Do not forget to stop it later once you are done developing

```
forgae node --stop
```

## Step 1. Update your ExampleContract.aes

Let's add some state and init parameters to our example contract which can be found at **contracts/ExampleContract.aes**

```
contract ExampleContract =
  record state =
    { savedNumber : int }

  public stateful function init(num : int) =
    { savedNumber = num }

  public function savedNumber() : int = state.savedNumber
```

As you can see the contract now has a state variable `savedNumber` of type int. The initial value will be passed by the init function. We've also added a read function for this value.

Run forgae compile to verify that your contract compiles successfully

```
forgae compile
```

#### Output of `forgae compile`:

```
===== Compiling contracts =====

Contract '/home/justin/forgae-init/contracts/ExampleContract.aes has been successfully compiled'
Contract bytecode: [contract bytecode]
```

## Step 2. Update your deploy.js

Let's add some parameters to our example deploy script which can be found at **deployment/deploy.js**. The parameters of the init functions are always passed as a tuple. Here is how our new deploy script looks like:

```
const Deployer = require('forgae-lib').Deployer;

const deploy = async (network, privateKey, compiler) => {
    let deployer = new Deployer(network, privateKey, compiler)

	let contract = await deployer.deploy("./contracts/ExampleContract.aes", [42])

	let encodedSavedNumber = await contract.call('savedNumber')
	let decodedSavedNumber = await encodedSavedNumber.decode("int")
	console.log(decodedSavedNumber) // 42
};

module.exports = {
	deploy
};

```

As you can see, we are now passing the initial value of `42` into the init parameters array. Note: If you are passing a parameter of type string, do not forget to add quotes `"` around the string too `"Some string"`. Multiple init parameters can be passed into the array, for example `[42, 24]`.

## Step 3. Run our deploy script

Running our deployment script with forgae is trivial. Just run:
```
forgae deploy
```

You will see the following output which includes our init parameter of `42`:

```
===== Contract: ExampleContract.aes has been deployed =====
42
Your deployment script finished successfully!
```

## Conclusion

Smart contracts are frequently in need of init params. Keep in mind the specifics of arrays and you will be able to successfully initialize your awesome æternity smart contracts.
